PICO IOT is a family of smart, interconnected modules that make any space intelligent. At its heart is a smart‑switch system that brings remote and automated control to standard electrical appliances—seamlessly integrating into households, offices, classrooms, and commercial spaces to manage everything from a single light bulb to an entire building’s power grid. Users control their devices from anywhere via a mobile app or voice commands (Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa). PICO IOT is the foundational step toward a truly smart, efficient, responsive environment. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
